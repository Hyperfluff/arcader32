/**
  Coin dispenser, test Program
  Name: dispenser_test
  Purpose: control a relay to simulate coins being thrown into the arcade machine
  Arduino IDE Version: 1.8.13

  @version 1.0.0 03/03/21
  this script is not designed to be used in the final machine, its only used to test the giveCredits and initRelay functions seperately from the main code
  if questions regarding the code arise feel free to contact me on the mail address below

//hardware configuration stuff
#define COIN_RELAY_PIN 0              //put the gpio pin here, that the relay is assigned to
#define COIN_RELAY_ON_STATE HIGH      //set this to LOW if your relay is a Low level trigger based relay

//timing stuff for the relay, values given in milliseconds
#define COIN_RELAY_ON_TIME 250        //set this to the time, the relay needs to be active in order to dispense a coin
#define COIN_RELAY_COOLDOWN_TIME 250  //this value defines how long the function waits after simulating a coin, so the machine can process the last coin signal first

//functional stuff for this test script

  //simulate the defined amount of coins to the machine

  //nothing to see here

  //control the coin acceptor interface
  //initialize variable i with 0 and check if its below the amount of coinse to dispense
  //then run the function to dispense one coin, add i + 1 and check again if its below the amount of coins to dispense
  //basically run the dispense function untill the amount has been dispensed
